# <subject> (This commit will... / I will have…) (Max 50 char)

# <body> (What and Why, not How)
# |<----   Try To Limit Each Line to a Maximum Of 72 Characters   ---->|


# --- COMMIT END ---

# BEST PRACTISES
# 1. Each commit should be a **single «logical change»**. Don’t make several «logical changes» in one commit
# 2. To write good commits, try to continue the sentece: *If applied, this commit will…* or  *After this commit, I will have…*
# 3. **Use a editor**, not the terminal, when writing a commit message
# 4. **Capitalize** the subject line
# 5. Use the **imperative** mood in the subject line
# 6. Do not end the subject line with a period
# 7. Separate subject from body with a **blank line**
# 8. Use the body to explain **what and why vs. how**
# 9. Can use multiple lines with “-“ for bullet points in body
